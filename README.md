# Calpourri

A potpourri of calendars. 
A sort of wiki for events in communities around the world. 

**This is an experimental project**

## Why: Organizing people is hard

Generally speaking, coordination and orginization is a very hard problem, 
and I believe that many of the technical solutions are sub-par
for the needs we have. 

Most calendaring solutions are built around an authoritative source, 
which makes sense because private concerns are best handled by those motivated to maintain order. 
But there is a secondary class of concern, 
a conern more diffuse and less interested in particulars and more wanting to find the diffuse connections within a geography.
This solution is designed to allow integration and organization
for civic activities, whether of public or private concern, to be made more accessable to people within a place.

The kernel of this idea comes from my particular circumstances within a large city, but I hope to design a system flexible enough to be useful to people all over the world.

For more thoughts on this matter, see [docs/theory](/docs/theory.md).

## What: Calendars — making and broadcasting

Just like Wikipedia is mostly used by readers who will do little to no writing, I imagine that calpourri is primarily a place for people to subscribe to calendars. Beyond just a 1-to-1 subscription though, calpourri will users to aggregate calendars into free-form lists that suit their needs.

Behind the scenes will be a basic CRUD app that allows volunteers and otherwise motivated users to build out the most accurate source of events that would otherwise fall short based on effort-reward circumstances. This is where the wiki hypothesis begins: can we build a system where people will altruistically volunteer to make the world more accessable?
